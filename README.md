# Hey, I’m Santiago 👋

Hey! I’m a Mathematical Engineering and AI **student** at ICAI, currently on exchange at UIUC. I’m especially interested in Large Language Models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, and cloud-native, data-intensive architectures.[file:31]

- 🧠 I work mainly with Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex.[file:31]  
- ☁️ I have experience with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL/NoSQL databases, and building end-to-end data/ML pipelines.[file:31]  
- 💻 I also enjoy full‑stack development with Django, React and modern web tooling.[file:31]  
- 👨‍🏫 I like teaching programming and collaborating in small, fast-moving teams where ideas quickly become prototypes.[file:31]  
- 🌍 Languages: Spanish (native), English (fluent, TOEFL 108), German (intermediate).[file:31]

I’m currently exploring how to build reliable, production-ready AI systems and how to better evaluate and monitor LLM‑based agents.
